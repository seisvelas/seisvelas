I am a thousand line shell script  
if you just forgot three commands.  
I am a mute actor  
miming only the words I'm brave enough to sign  
so when Othello tells Desdemona that he -  
but no, the lines are ripped off the page.  
So maybe I can't tell you in English how I feel
Do you speak Catal√°n?

We're just two country bumpkins  
but I need to tell you this.  
Maybe I could say it through a story

Once time I fell asleep at my desk, and when I woke up a strange script had appeared in my filesystem. So I ran it...

```bash
ale@earth$ python3 -Wignore -m trace --trace poem.py | perl -pe 's/^.*?://' | sed '1d;$d'
```
```python
for every,four_am in (('my', 'life'),):
    try:
        being; still; up
        the-screen-'s grey face'
        debugging.me
        # wait, is this still code?
        None # of this will even execute
        # an exception was already triggered
        # You know, I think I'm already asle... no,
        ~fuck * ~it
        continue
    except:
        f'inally...'
    finally:
        "I".find( 'a' )
        break

''and'', any((1, "can see"))
# I'm fast asleep
```

Maybe I did write it actually. Am I the author of my memories? Oh! The words I wanted to say. Yeah, narrative communication didn't help much, did it. Let's try this:

```ipython
In [2]: import hashlib                                                          

In [3]: hashlib.md5(three_words.encode()).hexdigest() 
   ...:                                                                         
Out[3]: 'e4f58a805a6e1fd0f6bef58c86f9ceb3'

```
